Project Overview
This project focuses on building a secure, scalable data pipeline and analytics solution for YouTube trending video data. 
The goal is to efficiently manage and analyze structured and semi-structured data, categorized by video genres and trending metrics. By harnessing AWS cloud services, we aim to streamline data ingestion, transformation, and visualization—turning raw data into meaningful insights.

Project Objectives
Data Ingestion: Create an automated process to collect data from multiple sources.

ETL Pipeline: Transform raw data into a clean, usable format suitable for analysis.

Centralized Storage (Data Lake): Store all data from different sources in a single, secure, scalable location.

Scalability: Design the system to handle growing data volumes without compromising performance.

Cloud Integration: Leverage AWS services to process and analyze data at scale (no more stressing local machines!).

Reporting & Insights: Develop an interactive dashboard to answer key business questions and provide actionable insights.

AWS Services
Amazon S3: Acts as our data lake, offering scalable, secure, and durable storage for all raw and processed data.

AWS IAM: Manages user access and permissions securely across all AWS resources.

AWS Glue: Handles data discovery, ETL processes, and prepares data for analytics.

AWS Lambda: Executes code for tasks like data ingestion and transformation—no servers to manage!

AWS Athena: Runs SQL queries directly on data stored in S3 without the need for complex data loading.

Amazon QuickSight: Builds sleek, interactive dashboards to visualize data and uncover trends.
